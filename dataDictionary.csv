Attribute,Alias,Column_Name,Units,Description
"fixed acidity","tartaric acid","fixed.acidity","g / dm^3","Most acids involved with wine or fixed or nonvolatile (do not evaporate readily)."
"volatile acidity","acetic acid (\"vinegar\"")","volatile.acidity","g / dm^3","The amount of acetic acid in wine\, which at too high of levels can lead to an unpleasant\, vinegar taste."
"citric acid",NA,"citric.acid","g / dm^3","Found in small quantities\, citric acid can add \"freshness\"" and flavor to wine."
"residual sugar","sugar","residual.sugar","g / dm^3","The amount of sugar remaining after fermentation stops. It's rare to find wines with less than 1 gram/liter and wines with greater than 45 grams/liter are considered sweet."
"chlorides","sodium chloride (\"salt\")","chlorides","g / dm^3","The amount of salt in the wine."
"free sulfur dioxide","free SO2","free.sulfur.dioxide","mg / dm^3","The free form of SO2 exists in equilibrium between molecular SO2 (as a dissolved gas) and bisulfite ion; it prevents microbial growth and the oxidation of wine."
"total sulfur dioxide","total SO2","total.sulfur.dioxide","mg / dm^3","Amount of free and bound forms of S02; in low concentrations\, SO2 is mostly undetectable in wine\, but at free SO2 concentrations over 50 ppm\, SO2 becomes evident in the nose and taste of wine."
"density",NA,"density","g / cm^3","The density is close to that of water depending on the percent alcohol and sugar content, and other variables like salt."
"pH","acidity","pH",NA,"Describes how acidic or basic a wine is on a scale from 0 (very acidic) to 14 (very basic); most wines are between 3-4 on the pH scale."
"sulphates","potassium sulphate","sulphates","g / dm3","A wine additive which can contribute to sulfur dioxide gas (S02) levels, wich acts as an antimicrobial and antioxidant."
"alcohol",NA,"alcohol","% ABV","The percent alcohol content of the wine."
"quality","rating","quality",NA,"Score between 0 and 10. Median of at least three expert taster ratings."
"citric range",NA,"citric.range","g / dm^3","Factor with levels at quarter-gram intervals\, centered on the quarter gram where clustering occurs (e.g. [0.125,0.375) g / dm^3)."
"citric thresh",NA,"citric.thresh","g / dm^3","Factor with levels at quarter-gram intervals\, where clustering occurs (e.g. [0.25,0.50) g / dm^3)"
"white chloride outliers",NA,"wht.chlor","g / dm^3","Binary factor for upper outliers (x > 0.06677236 g / dm^3)."
"red chloride outliers",NA,"red.chlor","g / dm^3","Binary factor for upper outliers (x > 0.1174665 g / dm^3)."
"high free SO2",NA,"free.SO2","mg / dm^3","Binary factor for free SO2 above 50 mg / dm^3\, the level at which it becomes noticable to the senses."
"bound SO2",NA,"bound.SO2","mg / dm^3","Total SO2 minus free SO2. This represents the amount of SO2 that has done \"work\" by bonding to other compounds."
"free SO2 per bound SO2",NA,"f_by_b.SO2","mg / dm^3","Free SO2 / bound SO2."
"sulphates per total SO2",NA,"sulph.by.SO2","g / dm^3","Sulphates / (total SO2 / 1000)."
"sugar",NA,"sugar","g / dm^3","Residual sugar factored at 3, 5.5, 9.5, and 16.5 g / dm^3 where there appear to be natural troughs."
"quality",NA,"qual",NA,"Numeric representation of quality ratings\, continuous but integers only."
"Alcohol levels",NA,"alc_fact","% ABV","Intuitively set factor levels based on slight observed clustering (split at 9.0, 9.75, 11.75, 13.25 %)"
